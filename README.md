# codeship-env-adapter

This action defines the same rich [environment variables as Codeship Pro](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/builds-and-configuration/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables) in your GitHub Workflow.

The action enables running existing Codeship scripts that reference variables like `CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE`, without having to refactor them to [GitHub Workflows Syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). Using this action, you can share scripts across your GitHub Workflow and Codeship builds, getting the best of both worlds ðŸŽ‰.

## Example Workflow Step

```yaml
name: Where are my env var?
steps:
  - uses: twistedpair/codeship-env-adapter@v0.0.1
    with:
      project-id: '123abc-project-id' # provide your project id, if you fancy 

  - name: Playback some env vars
    run: echo "Hi, I'm build $CI_COMMIT_ID"
```
## Covered Environment Variables

- `CI` - will be `true`
- `CI_BRANCH` - current ref branch
- `CI_BUILD_APPROVED` - will be `false`
- `CI_BUILD_ID` - uses ~GitHub build id~ per job UUID

- `CI_PROJECT_ID` - only set if provided as `project-id` in Action `with` config

## What this DOESN'T do

This action will **NOT** run `codeship-steps.yml` or `codeship-services.yml` files in GitHub Workflows.

If you want to run step files, run your builds in Codeship.
